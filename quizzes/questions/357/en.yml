question: What is the primary reason a paranoid Bitcoiner would use their own LN node?
answer: To maintain privacy and security
wrong_answers:
  - To avoid KYC processes
  - To manage their UTXOs
  - To mix their coins
explanation: |
  The chapter mentions that a paranoid Bitcoiner would use their own LN
  node as part of their focus on security. While avoiding KYC processes, managing
  UTXOs, and mixing coins are also activities a paranoid Bitcoiner might engage in,
  these are not directly related to the use of an LN node.
