# A Journey into the World of Non-KYC

Pierre offers us this course that delves into the various existing solutions for buying and selling bitcoins peer-to-peer. Peer-to-peer buying is completely legal and allows for more anonymity, as these solutions are not KYC. KYC (Know Your Customer) is a rule of market regulators (AMF) that requires identification from the customer wishing to buy or sell bitcoin. These rules aim to prevent money laundering, terrorism financing, and tax evasion. At the risk of significant consequences for the user, KYC aims to defend and protect its user, although the opposite effect is often observed.

We will therefore explore the different types of KYC (full KYC type France, KYC Light type Switzerland, and non-KYC type peer-to-peer). Pierre will present more than 6 solutions, so you will have all the cards in hand to discover which one suits you. If you want a KYC solution, know that they are present in the BTC 102 course.

# Introduction

## Explanation & Type of KYC

KYC, or "Know Your Customer," is a regulatory standard that requires the collection of private customer information, such as their physical address, identification, or bank statements. This practice is common on brokerage platforms, which may require a complete KYC, including detailed information such as identification, a photo, proof of address, salary sheets, etc.
The main objective of KYC is to combat money laundering, terrorism financing, and tax evasion. It is a law put in place by the AMF (Autorité des marchés financiers), the French market regulatory body. However, the application of KYC leads to the centralization of very sensitive databases containing personal user information. This information, having a certain value, can be sold to malicious entities.

In addition, exchange platforms often require an excessive amount of personal information, putting users at risk and increasing compliance costs. These regulatory costs can discourage French businesses and harm their competitiveness on an international scale.

There are three types of KYC, including full KYC which requires a complete and regulated collection of information to access the service. In Switzerland, an alternative called "KYC light" allows for the purchase and sale of bitcoins without providing identification, as long as the purchase amount does not exceed 1000 euros per day. Solutions like Relay allow for the use of this method.

In this context, Swiss authorities can access banking information to investigate individuals considered at risk. Bitcoin delivery addresses are also traceable through the banking system. KYC light is generally considered simpler and less expensive than the French system.

In France, buying bitcoins online requires sending money to a third party, via SEPA transfer or Paypal. For those who prioritize anonymity, security, and privacy, cash purchase solutions for bitcoins are also available. For low volumes, buying bitcoins in cash is a simple and legal option.

To be able to sell 100 euro PLT of bitcoin daily to anyone, regulation by the AMF (Financial Markets Authority) is necessary. In France, this regulation mainly applies to individuals who carry out significant transaction volumes. The other two methods of buying bitcoin include the use of automatic teller machines (ATMs) and exchanges between friends. ATMs are regulated and require identification for transactions over 500 euros. Exchange between friends, on the other hand, offers a more discreet exposure to bitcoin.

These regulatory measures are in place to counter terrorism financing, tax evasion, and money laundering. Bitcoin, as a fully traceable database, makes money laundering particularly difficult. The use of Bitcoin by criminals can be traced, making Bitcoin an ineffective tool for money laundering.

It is important to note that this training presents various alternatives, as well as tools that can be used for malicious or non-malicious purposes. Additionally, it provides explanations on the functioning of order books between makers (order providers) and takers (order takers).

It is also important to note that the information presented here does not endorse any particular solution. It simply presents the available options for a better understanding of the subject. For any additional questions about Bitcoin, do not hesitate to consult online resources such as www.découvrebitcoin.com.

## Conclusion on P2P solutions

In summary, each P2P solution has its advantages and disadvantages. Bisq is considered the most robust and secure, but less user-friendly. RoboSat is open source but less robust than Bisq. LNP2PBot is less robust and secure than other solutions, less fast and less user-friendly than RoboSat, but more than Bisq. Peach is the easiest and fastest application to buy Bitcoin without KYC, but there is a company behind it, so weaknesses in terms of security and robustness. HodlHodl is a protocol managed by a company and closed source, so weaknesses in terms of security and robustness, and a bit more complicated than Peach.

Good old cash face-to-face is still a solution for small amounts.

In addition to P2P solutions, there are other cryptocurrency exchange options. kycnot.me offers services such as VPN, VPS, SMS, etc. Bitrefil allows you to buy gift cards. Each solution on [kycnotme](https://kycnot.me/) is presented with its positive and negative points.

## Robosats

![robosats](https://tube.nuagelibre.fr/videos/watch/1978a2e0-64a0-4437-9229-7614cdf5bf61?start=0s)

[RoboSat](https://learn.robosats.com/) is an open source project developed by Reckless Satoshi to privately exchange Bitcoins for national currencies. It simplifies the peer-to-peer experience and uses Lightning invoices to minimize custody and trust needs. To use it, we will need Tor, an anonymous communication network.

The first thing you need to do is download Tor. You can find it on GitHub or directly on the official website at the following address: tor.org/download.
Once Tor is downloaded and installed:

- Press "Connect" to establish the connection.
- Go to the [robosats onion address](http://robosats6tkf3eva7x2voqso3a5wcorsnw34jveyxfqi2fu7oyheasid.onion/).
- Copy the token to save your identity.

Here are the steps to buy bitcoins with Robosats:

- Check the order book, you can filter by currency and payment method - for example, buy bitcoin in euros with Revolut.
- Before buying, check the offer expiration, the price in euros, and the premium (you can also filter offers by premium).
- Preferably, choose an offer with an active user and with a premium lower than the average.
- Check the order summary with the amount, payment method, premium, order ID, and expiration.
- You can receive your satoshis on a Bitcoin address with a swap-out fee (from LN to BTC-onchain) of around 1% (you can modify the on-chain mining fees).
- Otherwise, create an invoice with an LN wallet from this [list](https://learn.robosats.com/docs/wallets/) and copy the invoice to Robosats.
- Contact the seller via encrypted chat to discuss fiat payment.

Now let's see the steps for selling bitcoins on Robosats:

- Customize your offer by choosing the payment method, premium, expiration time, etc.
- Fidelity Bond Size is the equivalent of a security deposit on BISC. Put 15% or 10% of security deposits to encourage the other party to play fair.
- Lock the satoshis to confirm the creation of the order and avoid spam.
- If someone accepts your sales offer, discuss with the peer to proceed with fiat payment. Once payment is made, the trade is completed and the satoshis are sold!

## BISQ: peer-to-peer buying solution

[Bisq](https://bisq.network/) is a decentralized exchange platform for digital assets, mainly Bitcoin. It allows direct, secure, and private transactions between users worldwide without the need for an intermediary.

🚨 Please exercise caution when using Bisq as it is an advanced solution. It may not be suitable for beginner users. Make sure you have some experience and understanding before getting started. 🚨

For the more resourceful, here is a concise guide outlining the essential steps:

1. Download and Install: Visit the Bisq website and download the application. Install it on your system.
2. Configure Payment Method: Open the application and go to "Account". Add the details of your payment method.
3. Fund Your Bisq Wallet: Click on "Funds" and "Receive Funds" to get your Bisq address. Send Bitcoins to this address.

Here is a complete guide that will walk you through all the steps to use Bisq.

Bisq is a decentralized and secure network that respects your private property. It is non-custodial, meaning you always own your funds. Additionally, Bisq uses a token, BSQ, which allows you to pay lower transaction fees and encourages your participation in the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). To protect sellers during Bitcoin-fiat transactions, Bisq has implemented a system of signatures and account limits. As a buyer, you will need to obtain a signed account to increase your purchase limit. The signature is also a way to verify the history of traders, ensuring transaction security.

To install Bisq and backup your data, follow these simple steps:

- Go to the bisc.network website to download the software (Screenshot of the download page)
- Verify the integrity of the software using tools such as those provided by Loïc Morel for Windows users.
- Once the installer is verified, launch Bisq, grant necessary permissions, and accept the terms of use. (Screenshot of the terms of use)
- Bisq will connect to the Bitcoin network and itself via Tor, which may take some time.
- Set up your payment account and backup your Secure Identifier (SID) wallet to prevent loss or theft. (Screenshot of the account configuration page)
- Also, set up a password to encrypt your information.

Depending on your operating system, Bisq data will be stored in different locations. You can find them in the "Data Directory" folder. Be careful, if you delete this folder, all your Bisq data will be lost.
To recover your data using a backup:

- Copy the backup folder to the 'user/application support/BISQ' location.
- Rename the backup folder to 'BISQ'.
- Restart Bisq, and all your data should be restored.

Before buying or selling Bitcoin on Bisq, it is crucial to set up your payment account. For example, you can set up an account in your national currency, such as a SEPA account, a REVOLUT account, or a PAYPAL account.
To set up your REVOLUT account:

- Add an account and select REVOLUT from the list of options. (Screenshot of the account options list)
- You can choose different currencies: euro, pound sterling, US dollar, or Swiss franc.
- The maximum transaction duration is one day and the purchase limit is 0.25 Bitcoin.
- Use your personal REVOLUT account name to avoid confusion.
- Make sure to sign your accounts and establish purchase limits for added security.

To buy Bitcoin on BISQ:

- Go to the "Buy" section where you can choose different markets. (Screenshot of the "Buy" section)
- To benefit from reduced fees, we recommend buying BSQ, which you can buy with Bitcoin.
- You can choose from different offers based on price, quantity, payment method, etc.
- To buy BSQ, first deposit Bitcoin into your wallet.
- Choose an offer with a low premium and low quantity for buying BSQ.
- BISQ verifies the validity of the offer and the peer's connection.
- If the seller is not connected, choose another one.
- Check the offer and accept a 5% premium.
- Confirm the fees and BSQ exchange, then wait for transaction confirmation to buy Bitcoins with BSQ.

To sell Bitcoin on BISQ:

- Create a new offer in the "Sell" tab. (Screenshot of the "Sell" tab)
- You can choose to set the number of Bitcoins to sell or the amount in euros you want to receive.

## Bonus: Side Shift.AI

Here's a brief tutorial on using [SideShift AI](https://sideshift.ai/), a very useful tool for converting shitcoins to bitcoin. It's the ideal tool for those who have closed all their personal exchanges. No order system is required, and liquidity is available. However, please note that there is a 2.5% transaction fee.

If you bought cryptos in a KYC manner, it is recommended to use Monero to convert these cryptos to bitcoin. Monero offers greater privacy than Bitcoin. For increased security, the CoinJoin operation is also recommended. CoinJoin mixes your transactions with those of other users to complicate the traceability of your transactions.

I would also like to introduce you to an open-source tool for buying and selling bitcoins. This tool allows you to choose from many blockchains. Simply enter your Bitcoin address and select the amount you want to send. There is no need to create an account or connect your wallet to the tool. You can use a fixed rate to send or receive a specific amount. Additionally, this tool also allows for the sale of bitcoins in exchange for USDC.

## Interview with Steph from Peach Bitcoin

Here is a summary of the interview:

Peach Bitcoin is a non-custodial mobile application that allows for peer-to-peer buying and selling of Bitcoin. Currently, the Peach Bitcoin team, based in Switzerland, consists of eight members and is working to evolve the application to also serve as a wallet. Peach Bitcoin's unique model is based on a centralized company structure while maintaining a decentralized order book. Additionally, the application offers an option for cash transactions during in-person meetings.

One of the main advantages of Peach Bitcoin is the level of security it offers to users. The deskrow system with multisignature and time lock is designed to handle disputes and ensure transaction security. Additionally, Peach Bitcoin has priority access to the multisignature money, allowing it to transfer bitcoins to the buyer in case of malicious behavior by the seller. The company plans to integrate all European currencies as well as other payment methods when it launches in open beta in January.

The idea for Peach Bitcoin came from the founder's personal experience in the Bitcoin industry. After discovering Bitcoin in 2017 and attending several meetups and conferences, she became a Bitcoin maximalist and saw the opportunity to create a platform for Bitcoiners to meet and transact in cash. Additionally, the application includes an encrypted chat to communicate with other users, preserving user anonymity.

Currently, Peach Bitcoin is developing several features to make it easier for sellers, including creating an API for sellers, a platform for large sellers, and integrating BTC Pay Server to automate transfers. The application will be launched in open beta in January 2023.

In conclusion, the founder of Peach Bitcoin emphasizes the importance of competition in the Bitcoin ecosystem, as what is good for Bitcoin is beneficial for everyone. She also encourages diversity and inclusion in the Bitcoin industry and beyond.

This interview concludes the Bitcoin 205 training which addresses the subject of peer-to-peer Bitcoin purchasing solutions. Organized by Pierre, this training aims to educate the French-speaking public on the technical solutions for peer-to-peer Bitcoin purchasing, a field that has been neglected until now. Thanks to the progress made, it is now possible to buy and use Bitcoin while preserving one's privacy, even with a simple phone and the Telegram application.

One of the methods highlighted is the use of CoinJoin with Samouraï to enhance security. This solution minimizes the risks associated with centralized entities holding personal information about Bitcoin users. It is recommended to buy Bitcoins in a non-kyc way, a method that enhances anonymity. In addition, some exchange platforms like Kraken offer lower withdrawal fees than others, which aligns with Bitcoin principles.

Bisq, Robosat, and Peach are presented as democratic solutions for Bitcoin trading. Peach, in particular, is highlighted for its ease of access as a mobile application. However, there are challenges to be overcome, including cryptocurrency regulation and the need to respect certain limits to avoid excessive regulation.

The use of Bitcoin ATM dispensers is also discussed, as they represent an economical method for obtaining non-KYC bitcoins. Depending on local regulations, these dispensers can be installed at home or in public places and can be used to offer bitcoins to loved ones or for payments in bars.

The training emphasizes the importance of education in understanding Bitcoin. It is suggested that Bitcoin can offer a solution in the event of a recession or hyperinflation and that it is important to raise awareness of its potential before it is too late. In addition, it is emphasized that the separation of the state and currency is as essential as the separation of the state and religion.

In conclusion, Bitcoin is presented as a decentralized currency requiring public education and an open mind to be fully understood and used. The training aims to help participants understand the various peer-to-peer purchasing solutions and use these tools to enhance their anonymity and security when using Bitcoin.
